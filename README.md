## 📖 Overview

This repository contains Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) built using **Vite + React** and **Next.js 15**, both implemented with **TypeScript**. Each implementation demonstrates different approaches to creating fast, reliable, and engaging web applications - comparing the SPA approach with Vite against the full-stack approach with Next.js.

## 🎯 Goals

- **Compare Approaches**: SPA (Vite + React) vs Full-Stack (Next.js 15) PWA implementations
- **TypeScript First**: Demonstrate type-safe PWA development practices
- **Modern Tooling**: Utilize the latest features of Vite and Next.js 15 App Router
- **Performance**: Showcase optimization techniques for both approaches
- **Best Practices**: Implement PWA patterns and modern web standards

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This repository focuses on two main implementations, both built with **TypeScript** for better type safety and developer experience:

### 🏗️ Implementations
- [ ] **Vite + React** - Lightning-fast development with React and Vite bundler
  - ⚡ Vite for ultra-fast HMR and build times
  - ⚛️ React 19 with latest features
  - 🔷 TypeScript for type safety
  - 📱 PWA capabilities with Workbox

- [ ] **Next.js 15** - Full-stack React framework with App Router
  - 🚀 Next.js 15 with App Router architecture
  - 🔄 Server-side rendering and static generation
  - 🔷 TypeScript first-class support
  - 📱 Built-in PWA optimizations

## ✨ PWA Features

Each implementation includes the following PWA features:

### 🔧 Core Features
- **Service Worker** - Offline functionality and caching
- **Web App Manifest** - App-like installation experience
- **Responsive Design** - Works on all screen sizes
- **Fast Loading** - Optimized performance and loading times

### 🚀 Advanced Features
